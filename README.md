- Framework for creating pre-rendered React websites
- offers both server side rendering and static site generation

- server side rendering is when react components are rendered into html pages on the server after a page request comes from the browser

- static site generation is when components are rendered into html pages at build time so that we can just deploy the web pages and javascript bundles to the web

- benefits: pre rendering improves performance and better search engine optimization (SEO)

- each page in NEXT is driven by a React component

- every file you create in pages is a route for page
